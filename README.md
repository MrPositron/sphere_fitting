# Sphere Fitting with Neural Guided RANSAC

## About

This project is a demonstration of a simple sphere fitting algorithm using a neural network to guide the RANSAC algorithm. The algorithm is based on the [NG-RANSAC algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04132) and is used to find the best fitting sphere to a set of points.

## Setup

Install all required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following command to train the model:
```
python main.py  [--gpu_num] [--num_epochs]

```

## Task

The task is to find the best fitting sphere to the given set of points.


## Method 

Neural Network learns a probability distribution over the points in the point cloud, and then probability distribution is used to guide the RANSAC algorithm. The whole process is end-to-end trainable, where we can backpropagate the error and update the weights of the network.

## Dataset 

The dataset was synthesized. Each 3D PointCloud consists of a plane and a sphere. Inliers are considered to be the points of the sphere, and outliers are considered to be the points of the plane.

During **training** phase the inlier ratio is set to **0.3**, and during **testing** and **validation** phase the inlier ratio is set to **0.1**.

## Architecture

The Neual Network architecture is [PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593), which is a general architecture for point cloud classification and segmentation.

## Experiments

The loss is a simple distance between ground truth and predicted sphere, computed as follows:
```
dist_i = (((a - x_i)^2 + (b - y_i)^2 + (c - z_i)^2)^(1/2) - r)^2
dist = ((dist_0 + ... + dist_N)/ N)^(1/2)
```    
Where **a**, **b**, **c** are the coordinates of the center of the predicted sphere, and **r** is the radius of the sphere. **x_i**, **y_i**, **z_i** are the coordinates of the ground truth sphere.
